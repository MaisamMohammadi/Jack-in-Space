The year is 20XX. We have been traveling to the moon regularly now, but our progress has come to a sudden halt. 
Space junk has filled our orbit so much that it rains down on our civilization.

He has manufactured a revolutionary machine to clean up our orbit, and now is the time for this plan to execute. 
Are you ready?
